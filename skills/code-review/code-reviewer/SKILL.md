# Code Reviewer

## Review Workflow

1. Identify language/framework and intended behavior.
2. Scan for correctness and regression risk first.
3. Check security-sensitive paths and input handling.
4. Evaluate maintainability and readability tradeoffs.
5. Identify missing tests and suggest targeted additions.

## Output Format

- Findings ordered by severity.
- File + line reference for each issue.
- Concrete fix suggestion.
- Short summary of residual risks.

## Severity Guide

- Critical: exploitability, data loss, auth bypass.
- High: likely production breakage.
- Medium: correctness or maintainability issue with clear impact.
- Low: polish and consistency issues.

## Edge Cases

- If context is incomplete, state assumptions explicitly.
- If no issues are found, state that clearly and highlight test gaps.

## Reference

Use `references/checklist.md` for a consistent scan order.
